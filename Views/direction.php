        <h1>Unleash the Power of Learning in the Physical Library</h1>
    </header>
    <p class="fs-5"> While the E-library offers unparalleled convenience, the physical library provides a distinct
        learning
        environment. Imagine yourself surrounded by towering shelves overflowing with books on every imaginable
        topic.
        The scent of aged paper mingles with the quiet hum of focused students. This dedicated space fosters a sense
        of calm and concentration, allowing you to delve deeper into your studies.
        Here at the University, we believe the E-library and the
        physical library work in harmony, providing a comprehensive learning environment to support your academic
        journey.
